# Tomplate with recursive placeholders
# Tests: Section 5.5.4 - Recursive Resolution

# Simple recursion - value references other value
base_path: ${paths.base}
full_path: ${paths.base}/${paths.sub}
deeply_nested: ${paths.base}/${paths.sub}/${paths.file}

# Chain of references
step1: ${refs.a}
step2: ${refs.b}
step3: ${refs.c}

# Self-reference guard (should error after 10 levels)
# recursive: ${recursive}
